# game-project-3d: Metal Himiko
In development. Just a 3d game for desktop. Linux and Windows compatible. There is a small 3d engine too.

## Stats

Time spent: 2 hours.

## Requirements

A computer with display, just this.

The computer I using is a Intel duo E5300 without gpu... So this game runs in a potato with esp32 and 4MB of ram.


## Description

You are a discarded robot, trying to be the best project of your master, so you need to improve yourself, defend your master and destroy others projects with bad intuitions.

- Top view 3d Game
- Decisions and 2 End games.


## Goals

Game time: ~1 hour to beat each end.

Requirements: Run in any potato powered by a Esp32 with 4 MB ram, also runs on Windows and Linux.


Why? Is just a test of all my abilities, 3d art, programming, design, all. So I'll use jus libraries in programming, but all other things like assets, soundtrack, needs o be my arts.


AI: No, just no. No AI arts, no scripts from AI, not because isnt helpful, but because is MY test, so needs to be MY abilites, ME proving to myself that I can do this. If you dont believe me, I don care. this test is for myself, no others.


Feel free to use any part of this project, just credit my name pls ( ´◔ ω◔`)
